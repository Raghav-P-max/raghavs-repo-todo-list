### PROJECT: TO CREATE A TO-DO LIST WHERE WE CAN ADD, REMOVE TASKS FROM A LIST, AND STORE THOSE TASKS IN A TEXT FILE.

First, I created an empty list named 'tasks'.
Then, I created functions to add and remove elements(tasks) from the 'tasks' list.

I created 'save_tasks' and 'read_tasks_in_file' functions to store and display the tasks in a text file called 'tasks.txt'.
Additionally, I also created a show_list() function, which outputs the entire list to the console.

Depending on the number the user enters, the program behaves accordingly.

## To make this program, I used ChatGPT AI tool for reference to get a general idea on how to make such a program. Other than this, I used my own coding skills in Python to develop this program.
